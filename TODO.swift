 vision os standalone todo:::


 add to the virtualclock class to make it automatically scheudle when to refresh weather.
 allow in vitual mode to still teleport.
 add settings
allow customize time size, color
add battery option



 1. eventually save standalone using swiftdata to know what to default to.
 2. for now make it default standalone mode on.
 3. get weather data from internet instead of clock if so.
 4. make it be able to get current location.
 5. add in app purchases

 make vison os version work without being connencted to the prismbox for people who just have a vision pro so its not useless
 if you dont have one.
 create separate app for it


 // done::
 - fix 3d model
 - assemble s3 board
 - publish app
 - polish ios app
 worry about vision app way later.


 user connects -> clock sends current state

 // todo::
 make on connect the app successfully print out the state of the clock into compareable values.

 user changes setting -> app changes pending command to the clock, and app sets pending local varaible to the command.

 clock recieves command, sets pending mode to the command.

 clock then does what it needs to get to the mode requested.

 once clock detects that the current mode is now matched to the pending mode, resend clock state to app.

 app recieves state update -> app compares current state to pending mode it set, it will see that current mode now matches pending state.


// what do i want this to do?

 // main menu?
 
 1.2 removed some facts.
